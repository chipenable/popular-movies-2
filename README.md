PopularMovies is a training app for Udacity Android Course.
It's a simple REST client for themoviedb.org service.

To launch this app you have to get API Key (https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api)
and add it in MovieService.java file.

//MovieClient.java
String KEY = "";

Libraries, that I used for this app:
- Retrofit - http://square.github.io/retrofit
- Glide - https://github.com/bumptech/glide
- Butterknife - http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/
